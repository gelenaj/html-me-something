<h1>Modern day apartheid </h1>

  Overtown is a neighborhood northwest of Downtown Miami and it is one of the oldest areas in the City of Miami. During the Jim Crow era it was a segregated and bustling neighborhood called the Central Negro District or Colored Town.
  In the 1960s Overtown went into decline after it was divided by Interstate 95 and caused internally forced displacement of community members. History repeats itself.<br>
  <br>
  A new wall has been constructed separating Overtown from Park West for a train that will transport people from Miami to Orlando.  The wall will go from NW First Avenue from the I-395 overpass to the corner of NW Eighth Street.
  According to Clarence Woods, executive director of Southeast Overtown/Park West Community, “It’s not a wall. It’s a platform for the rail”.  The first thing a white collar criminal reaches for must be a thesaurus.
  Whether a “platform” or a “wall”, it is no less exclusionary—there is no longer an “us” in a common space, rather, an “us” on one side and “them” on the other. Were Oertown a white neighborhood with resources, you can bet this would
  be a different a story.

<h1>Mother Nature versus Miami Beach</h1>

  Any report on sea level rise in Florida will paint a dark future for Florida. Rain in Miami is a nightmare. Miami Beach, is not only illustrative of the havoc rain cause in the area-- it is an endless pit of spending to fight flooding.
  In 1870, when two profiteers arrived in Miami Beach, it was little more than a sandbar and mangrove ridge but what they saw was a profit waiting to be turned. Since then, the man-versus-nature battle has never ended (but it is clear
  who is winning). These New Jersian profiteers chopped off the mangroves and filled it in with soil and a new artificial city was born.  Miami Beach’s problem is that sea-level rise and global warming are inevitably winners and yet
  Miami Beach won’t give up. The rainwater is not the only thing going down the drain. Mayor Levin has pushed a $500 million anti-flooding program that will install pumps, build higher sea walls and fix drainage systems.
  <blockquote>“If you live in South Florida and you’re not building a boat, you’re not facing reality.” -Jeff Goodell</blockquote>
  <br>
  In a weak effort to beat mother nature, Miami Beach has spent million dollars and counting as the profit motive rules out any other solution than to protect the high-priced realty—calculated at $40 billion worth of properties.
  This means that any ideas like depopulation are out of the question although this proposal is being discussed for Miami’s Shorecrest neighborhood. One can’t help but wonder what these hundreds of millions of dollars could be used
  for if other problems the city faces were seen as important as saving a drowning Miami Beach. How many homeless people could receive housing, health services and job training? How much could teacher salaries be increased to maintain
  the best teachers in the job and attract talent that would otherwise move into a higher paying field?

<h1>Wynwood: Cool Gentrification</h1>
<img src="images/paradise.jpg">
<article>
  People flock to Wynwood for many reasons—the food, the art and parties. It offers something different than the lux-chic platter offered by the rest of Miami. But the guy eating an gourmet croissant doesn’t want to hear about
  how people were pushed out so that he could savor his pastry. And the small business rejoice of being part of creating the monster that is Wynwood, spinning it as a success story of how revitalization took abandoned warehouse
  and a crime ridden area and turned it into something great. That is a misleading story of course. A more accurate story would tell a tale of two profiteers who exploited an economically low resource neighborhood.
  <blockquote>[I] took chicken shit and made chicken salad.” -Lombardi, Wynwood Developer</blockquote>
  Some numbers: between 2012 and 2016 land prices in Wynwood more than quintuples and lease rates more than doubles. 2014 parking was suddenly not free in Wynwood as the City realized it too could profit from the gentrification
  happing in the area. In a city were income inequality is so great, developers like those that created Wynwood are hurting the city more than they are helping it.
